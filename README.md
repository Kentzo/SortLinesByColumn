SortLinesByColumn
=================

Column is determined by selected word of the last selected line.

By default line is srtipped before splitted and sorted. You can disable this by setting `sortlinesbycolumn_should_strip` to `false`.

Default regexp to strip line is `'\W+'`. You can change it by setting `sortlinesbycolumn_split_regexp`.

Based on implementation by [derekh](http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&p=41917)
